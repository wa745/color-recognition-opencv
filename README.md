Color Recognition using OpenCV

This project implements a real-time color recognition system using Python and OpenCV.

 What it does

- Captures video from the webcam.
- When you click on any point in the video, it shows:
  - The RGB color values at that point.
  - A rectangle displaying the color.
  - The name of the basic color (like red, green, yellow...).

Project Structure

- `color_recognition.py` — Main script to run the color recognition system.

 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy

 Example Output

The following image demonstrates the result of running the color recognition project:

- The user clicked on a specific area in the webcam feed.
- A small rectangle appeared, filled with the detected color.
- The name of the basic color (e.g., Red, Green) and its RGB values were displayed near the click.
